    "\n",
    "`topologic` contains extensive `io` and `projections` packages for loading data in many ways.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some sources of data are multigraphs, and you may need to make some hard decisions on how you want to handle converting a multigraph into a undirected or directed simple graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "On edge duplication, do you want to:\n",
    "- Sum the weights?\n",
    "- Average them?\n",
    "- Take the latest?\n",
    "- Exclude edges based on some other attribute criteria?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can always pre-process your data to answer this question for you, and write everything you need from scratch.  This is a valid strategy and if you feel most comfortable with it, you can either create your own `networkx` Graph objects or use the simple `topologic.io.from_file` function to create a graph for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "`topologic` also contains a number of utility functions and a general opinionated paradigm for operating over input files when building a graph which may help you quickly transform all of your various source files into the exact graph you wish to analyze with the rest of `topologic`'s capabilities.  This notebook will show how to use this.  The main reason to use this is if you expect to do similar sorts of projections, possibly with minor configuration differences, across many different source files.  Building a corpus of convenient projections could save you a lot of time in the future, especially in an enterprise environment. \n",
