# topologic jupyter notebooks

This folder contains a few notebooks that illustrate some common usages of the topologic library.

To run, you will need to have `topologic` in the same python environment that `jupyter` is installed in.  

The following notebooks use our test data from our unit test folders and is located `../tests/test_data`.  Each notebook is committed with results inline so they can be used as tutorials,
but we hope you will use these as a basis to explore topologic on your own.
