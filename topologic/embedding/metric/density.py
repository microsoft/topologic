    Calculates the internal and external densities given a graph and a node membership dictionary. Density is defined
    by 'How to Make the Team: Social Networks vs. Demography as Criteria for Designing Effective Teams' as being
    the mean strength of tie between members of the set. In other words, density is the normalized average of edge
    weights by node.

    For a given node, the density is the sum of all edge weights divided by the maximum edge weight for that node.

    For internal density, only the edge's whose target node is in the same membership group will be summed. Similarly,
    for external density, only the edge's whose target node is not in the same membership group will be summed.
